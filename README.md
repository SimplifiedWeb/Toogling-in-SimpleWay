check out demo: https://simplifiedweb.github.io/Toogling-in-SimpleWay/
So basically I'm gonna give you a clear idea where to use this, and how to use this.

So this is pretty straightForward and Easy.
Simple The logic here was a Toggle and the classlist methods.

so Simply we're doing here, Toggling the Button means that, ON or OFF That's is what
a toggling means. So we are doing here is Like When we First Click, it's gets ON and when
we Click again Then it gets OFF. 
So, ON -> adding classList (in this dark is a class were adding)
    OFF -> removing classList Default (Back To Normal)

//Toggle Working inside the Hood.
So when user Click on that button Toggle add a classlist called dark. and when
 the user click again than Toggle remove that class. 
So it's simple like ON or OFF. And this all the Functionality is inside the Toggle Method.

So whenever we want to make something ON or OFF than we use the Toggle method. To make it
Shine and go back to Normal.
